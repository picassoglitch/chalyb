-- Server-only RPCs: take them back from anon and authenticated.
--
-- These SECURITY DEFINER functions are meant for the server (service_role)
-- only, and their migrations say so with `revoke all ... from public`. On
-- Supabase that is not enough: the project's default privileges grant
-- EXECUTE on every new function in `public` to anon and authenticated
-- directly, not through PUBLIC, so both roles can still call them through
-- PostgREST (/rest/v1/rpc/<name>) with the publishable key. For admit_usage
-- and settle_usage_reservation that means reserving or settling against any
-- user id; the compute_*, metrics and cost functions read every user's usage.
--
-- grant_token_pack, clawback_token_pack, adjust_token_bonus_balance and
-- check_contact_rate_limit already revoke from anon and authenticated by name.
-- is_admin() stays callable: RLS policies run it as the caller. Trigger
-- functions can't be called through RPC.
--
-- usage_margin_percent() never had its PUBLIC grant revoked (0046); it's only
-- read inside the usage_events_price trigger, which runs as its owner.
